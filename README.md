Code for RA-L with ICRA 2022 paper: Stacked Convolutional Supervised Auto-encoder Based on Improved Earth Moverâ€™s Distance Loss for Tactile Hardness Recognition
## Introduction
We propose an ordinal classification method to recognize the hardness of objects. To verify the performance of the proposed method, we use a real robot to collect a tactile hardness dataset on silicone samples of three different shapes. Experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves better performance in terms of accuracy and quadratic weighted kappa (QWK).
## Environment
This code is based on Keras. It has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
